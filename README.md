# math446-final-project
Final Project on Ethereum and NVVH (Net Value vs. Hold) for MATH446

We have defined a new metrics NVVH for assessing impermanent loss by taking transaction fee gained into account. </br>
We also built a random forest classifition model based on factors highly correlated with NVVH (time in the pool, eth price at burn and mint time). The model has an r2 of 0.69.
